				The start of the 2024 tennis season will be here in a few weeks!
				Tournaments will begin in Australia and first up will be the
				second edition of the <span>United Cup</span> played in{" "}
				<span>Perth and Sydney</span>, followed by <span>Brisbane</span>{" "}
				which will be Rafa Nadal's first tournament since the Australian
				Open. Depending on which country you live in, you may not have
				access to a live broadcast of a tournament due to{" "}
				<span>geo-restrictions.</span> Another roadblock fans run into
				are <span>blackout policies</span> which prevent certain
				locations from streaming an event due to TV station broadcasting
				rights. Fortunately you can bypass these restrictions using a
				VPN and <span>masking your actual IP address.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, if you are in Australia then Channel 9Now will be
				broadcasting the Australian Open for free. However, if you
				reside outside Australia you may not have access to a live
				broadcast and will need to connect to a streaming service to
				watch the tournament.

				Many tennis matches cannot be streamed from various locations
				because of <span>exclusive broadcast rights</span> that cable TV
				networks acquire. This leads to streaming <span>blackouts</span>{" "}

				from watching an event.
