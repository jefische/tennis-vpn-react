				The 2025 tennis season has been nothing short of amazing! <span>Jannik Sinner</span> has displayed some incredible tennis,
				dominating contender Alexander Zverev in the final 6-3, 7-6(4), 6-3 to capture his second Australian Open title. On the
				womens side <span>Madison Keys</span> put up impressive victories on her way to win her first grand slam title in Australia.
				With arguably the toughest draw in the tournament, Keys defeated Elena Rybakina, Elina Svitolina, 2 seed Iga Swiatek, and 1
				seed Aryna Sabalenka. Congratulations Madison!
			</p>
			<p>
				With <span>Roland Garros</span> and <span>Wimbledon</span> coming soon, there is plenty of high level tennis to watch.
				However, depending on which country you live in, you may not have access to a live broadcast of a tournament due to{" "}
				<span>geo-restrictions.</span> Another roadblock fans run into are <span>blackout policies</span> which prevent certain
				locations from streaming an event due to TV station broadcasting rights. Fortunately you can bypass these restrictions using
				a VPN and <span>masking your actual IP address.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, if you are in Australia then Channel 9Now will be broadcasting the Australian Open and other grand slams for
				free. However, if you reside outside Australia you may not have access to a live broadcast and will need to connect to a
				streaming service to watch the tournament.

				<p>
					If you're looking to cut the cord there are multiple options to watch tennis with just an internet connection. Some of
					the best streaming services include <span>Sling TV, ESPN+, TSN, Eurosport and Tennis Channel Plus.</span> To{" "}
					<span>unblock any geo-restrictions</span> you might face when accessing these services, you'll need a reliable VPN.
				</p>
				<p>Below is a list of some streaming services by country and the cost per month.</p>

			<div id="toc3" className="bposts">
				<h2 className="mt-5">Why do you need a VPN?</h2>
				<p>
					Many tennis matches cannot be streamed from various locations because of <span>exclusive broadcast rights</span> that
					cable TV networks acquire. This leads to streaming <span>blackouts</span> or <span>geo-restrictions</span> that prevent
					many tennis fans from watching an event.
				</p>
				<p>
					The good news is that you can easily bypass these restrictions using a reliable VPN. We highly recommend{" "}
					<a href={vpn.generalTennisLink}>ExpressVPN</a> for <span>reliability, speed, and security.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					ExpressVPN has <span>over 3,000 servers in 94 countires</span> meaning you'll have no problem finding a server in your
					region of choice.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, ExpressVPN <span>uses 10Gbps servers</span> for extremely fast service and allows users to{" "}
					<span>connect up to 8 devices.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href={vpn.generalTennisLink}>ExpressVPN - 49% OFF</a> is currently offering a 12 month +3 months free promotion for{" "}
					<span>$6.67/month.</span> All subscriptions also come with a <span>30-day money back guarantee.</span> This is an
					excellent purchase for the quality of service you receive.

			<h2 className="mt-5">Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				The landscape of broadcasting rights and licensing is always changing. Most recently in the UK, Amazon Prime will be
				dropping international tennis tournament coverage after 2023. Sky Sports may take over some of the coverage as they have
				covered the ATP tour before. To <span>avoid paying for expensive cable plans</span>, having access to a{" "}
				<span>quality VPN</span> is a must have to bypass geo-restrictions and help you watch more tennis!
